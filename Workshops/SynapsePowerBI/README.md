# Synapse and Power BI E2E Solution

Welcome to the Syanpse and Power BI workshop. In this workshop, you will learn all about the Mixed Reality (MR) controls in Power Apps. At the end of this workshop, you will have built your first app with MR controls. The workshop consists of multiple labs and some overview presentations to set the scenes.

## Agenda

### 👩🏾‍💻 Lab 0 - Setup your environment

This lab is all about setting up your environment. This is what you need to get started. Make sure to do this before starting the workshop.

### 📺 Introduction to Microsoft Synapse

During this section, an introduction to the Power Platform will be given. You get answers to questions like:

- What is the Power Platform?
- What does it consist of?
- What's in it for me?
- How do I learn more about it?

### 📺 Introduction to Power BI

In this section, you will get an overview of what Power Apps is, what types of Power Apps there are, and we will elaborate on which controls you can use. The Creator Kit components and Mixed Reality (MR) controls will get the spotlight, because we are going to use those later in the labs!

### 👩🏾‍💻 Lab 1 - Create a Data Solution on Azure Synapse Analytics with Snapshot Serengeti: A step by step guide for beginners.

It's time to get to work! In this lab, you will learn about components. The Creator Kit offers a set of components that are ready for reuse and that's what we are going to use in this lab.

### 👩🏾‍💻 Lab 2 - View in MR in Canvas Apps

In this lab, you'll create two galleries that'll provide a list of all objects available for view in mixed reality. Once the galleries are configured, you'll create a information screen that'll provide details about the object in addition to functionality to view the model in your physical environment.

# Lab 01 - Create your first Custom Connector

When you're ready to create a Power Platform solution, like we're going to do today, you always want to start by going to the maker portal. In this case, we're going to the Power Automate maker portal.

[ðŸ¤– Power Automate Maker Portal](https://make.powerautomate.com)

> **Note:**
>
> It's very important to create a solution and not start from Data > Custom connectors. Solutions give you a lot more possibilities. For instance, you can more easily perform application lifecycle management (ALM) on it.

Navigate to solutions in the left hand menu. In the solution view, click the '**+ New Solution**' button at the top. A side bar will open where you can add your solutions' display name, name (internal name), a publisher and a version.

> **Note:**
>
> Be aware that the new publisher will have a prefix value. That prefix value will be added to the internal name of every component you create in this solution. When you use 'msft' as a prefix, you will get 'msft\_' as a prefix before every component that gets created in the solution.

For this solution, we will use the following values:

- **Display Name**: Mixed Reality Workshop
- **Name**: MixedRealityWorkshop
- **Publisher**: create a new one to your own liking and select that one when you are done creating it
- **Version**: 1.0.0.0

There is also a 'more options' option available, but we will not use that in this workshop.
